# NumericalComputation-Codes
Numerical Computation is one of my favorite classes of all time. It gives us one way of setting up computers to work with our math. Pretty cool, right? In this repo, I'll release the latest codes I've build to test/exemplify/play with its concepts. Feel free to use it, to comment it, to propose changes, etc. Don't be shy... play around!
